# Hey!!! Hi!!! This is a small, fun project I'm working on in my free time. So far, it's just a silly clicker game: you click, and you get points.
Some funny features include an upgrade and a decoration button, with 5 decoration types so far.
If you have any ideas, lmk!! :)
## Oh yeah, you need a .net framework, probably 6.0+ preferably

##### Id assume vs 2019 projects can go up to vs 2022, I've gotta try it out
